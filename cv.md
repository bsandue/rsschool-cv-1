### Code Example:
[KATA from CODEWARS:](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ca8246d751df55cc00014c/train/javascript) a hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
Return true if yes, false otherwise

 
 ```
	function hero(bullets, dragons) {
		if (bullets - (dragons * 2) >= 0)
		  return true;
		else
		  return false;
	}
